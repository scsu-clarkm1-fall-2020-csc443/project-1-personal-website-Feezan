# Site Plan - FizzCode.com


## Overview

Create a website designed to display a beginner's level guide to coding in the Java language. The user will be able to ask questions into a forum where anyone can answer the questions. 

As the transition to online learning seems to be a stressful time for students, having access to in-depth guide on how to code and understand simple topics like loops and data structures. Coders today, use Google many times each day looking up how to solve a problem efficiently. The forum will provide a new Google/Reddit approach to solving coding examples.

This site will be interactive for the forum section but the other sections will be static. It will show images/topics and explanations of those images/topics divided into mulitple pages. The pages will be the home page consiting of images and links to loops, data structures, coding challenges and a forum.

## Goals

The primary goals of the site and corresponding objectives are given below.

### Provide General Knowledge of Coding Concepts

* Provide in-depth descriptions and examples of coding concepts 
* Provide examples relating to the topics that help better understand the subject.

### Provide Challenges for Users

* Provide coding examples for potential software developers or students who want to test their skills

### Q&A Forum for Users

* Increase the use of the website for people who want to ask/answer questions

## Target Users

There are two main user categories that are expected to use/visit the site.

### Jon - The Software Developer

Jon is a 34 year-old software developer for a tech start-up. He works remotely from his home and is often stuck finding solutions to difficult tasks. His job requires him to be up to date on efficient methods to develop/update his algorithms. 

Jon has just developed in advanced algorithm and he is getting a code-breaking error but he doesnt know how to fix it. He goes to FizzCode to access the forum and ask for help to see if he can get some help.

He visits my site and finds a forum detailing the same error and its solution in Java. 

### Jonah - Computer Science Major at SCSU

Jonah is an 18 year old college student in his freshman year of college. He is taking his first computer science introductory class at SCSU. 

Jonah is struggling adapting to the new remote learning change. He has trouble understanding loops in Java which he needs to understand to complete his first coding assignment.

He visits my webpage and find a descriptive section in the data structures tab on loops where he is able to figure out how to iterate through an array. 

## Content

### Home

Visitors will land on this eye-catching homepage where they will see a very organized tabs that are easy to navigate to.

### Loops

This page will be an in-depth description on for and while loops. It will provide examples of traversing through arrays using both methods.

### Data Structures

This data shows examples and methods of implementing data structures likes arrays, stacks, queues etc. How to access elements within these 

### Coding Challenges

A list of programming challenges and their solutions so people can test their skills with topics they have learned in class or on the FizzCode.

### Forum

This form will serve as a question and answer format much similar to Reddit. People who want to ask or answer questions can post here.
